## Binary Search

Binary search is a fundamental algorithm used to efficiently locate a target value within a sorted array. This section provides an overview of the binary search program in C++.

### Purpose

The binary search program demonstrates the implementation of the binary search algorithm in C++. It allows you to efficiently find a target value in a sorted array.

### How to Use

To use the binary search program:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hamzamalik22/DSA-Cpp.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository:

    ```bash
    cd DSA-Cpp
    ```

3. Compile and run the program:

    ```bash
    g++ your-required-program.cpp -o your-required-program
    ./your-required-program
    ```
